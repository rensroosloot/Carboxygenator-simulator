# Validation Plan

## 1. Document Control
- Version: `0.1`
- Date: `2026-02-16`
- Status: Draft
- Owner: Research/Engineering

## 2. System Description
- System name: `CarboxySim`
- Intended use: Time-based 0D simulation of O2/N2 transfer into PBS.

## 3. GAMP5 Classification
- Category: `TBD` (expected: Category 5 custom application)
- Rationale:
  - `TBD`

## 4. Validation Strategy
- Approach: Risk-based validation aligned to URS, DS, FS.
- Traceability required from requirement to executed test evidence.

## 5. Scope of Validation
- In scope:
  - Core simulation functions
  - Input validation
  - Solver behavior
  - Export behavior
  - UI run/render smoke behavior
- Out of scope:
  - `TBD`

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities
- Requirement owner: `TBD`
- Design owner: `TBD`
- Test owner: `TBD`
- Approver: `TBD`

## 7. Deliverables
- `docs/validation/RiskAssessment.md`
- `docs/validation/RTM.md`
- `docs/validation/TestProtocol.md`
- `docs/validation/TestReport.md`

## 8. Entry and Exit Criteria
- Entry:
  - URS/DS/FS baselined
  - Risks identified
  - Protocol approved
- Exit:
  - Tests executed
  - Deviations resolved or accepted
  - RTM complete without open gaps

## 9. Deviations
- Process for deviations:
  - Log deviation ID, description, impact, resolution, approver.
